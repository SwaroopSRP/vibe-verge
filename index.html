                            In less than half a decade, the Toronto-born rapper Drake went from being a former child actor and Lil Wayne’s protégé to one of the world’s biggest entertainers.
                            The indelible pop hooks and bleeding-heart lyricism found on his early albums, especially 2010’s Thank Me Later and 2011’s Take Care, won him legions of fans and plenty of scorn. A year after releasing the massively successful album Views in 2016, Drake offered up what he termed a “playlist” instead of a traditional album, More Life, on which he embraced diasporic musical influences like South African house and tropicália.
                            His experimental streak continued with the following year’s double album, Scorpion, which found Drake dividing his rap persona and R&B persona into separate discs.
                            2019’s Care Package collected tracks released between 2010 and 2016 that were previously unavailable for commercial purchase.
                            Dark Lane Demo Tapes, Drake’s first full-length project in two years, was released in 2020. He’s gone on to release Certified Lover Boy, Honestly, Nevermind, and Her Loss.
